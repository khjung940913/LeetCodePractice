# Pattern

1. Two Pointers

What? An algorithm that utilizes two pointers in a linear search O(n)
    - inward traversal
    - unidirectional traversal
    - staged traversal
When? 
    - the input follows a predictable dynamic, such as a sorted array.
    - problem ask a pair of value in an array.
    - result that can be generated from two values.
