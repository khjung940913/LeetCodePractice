# Pattern
<br>
1. Two Pointers <br>

What? An algorithm that utilizes two pointers in a linear search O(n)<br>
    - inward traversal<br>
    - unidirectional traversal<br>
    - staged traversal<br>
When? <br>
    - the input follows a predictable dynamic, such as a sorted array.<br>
    - problem ask a pair of value in an array.<br>
    - result that can be generated from two values.<br>
